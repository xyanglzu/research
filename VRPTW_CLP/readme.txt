Description: 
Solving a VRPTW, the solutions guarantee that goods arrive at the client on time. But to ensure that goods do not suffer 
any damage a stable load is necessary. This demand is achieved by solving the CLP. The desired quantities demand is fulfilled by 
solving the VRPTW and CLP in an integrated way. The classical model of vehicle routing guarantees that the totality of the clients’ demand,
assigned to that vehicle, doesn’t exceed, the vehicle capacity restrictions in terms of weight. 
However it is not guaranteed that the cargo can be physically loaded and arranged inside the vehicle. 
So a cargo, which in terms of weight can be packed in a vehicle, can exceed its volume capacity, or vice versa. 
We propose 46 problem instances of an integrated problem (Vehicle Routing and Loading Problem). 
The problems instances are divided in two classes: I1 (R1 and BR2) and I2 (R2 and BR2). 
For each problem class two different groups were defined. 
In Group I, clients’ demand varies from 30 to 80 boxes, with 1 to 5 box types per client and an average of 42 boxes per demand. 
The total number of boxes is 1050. In Group II, clients’ demand varies from 50 to 100 boxes, 
with 1 to 5 box types per client and an average of 62 boxes per demand. The total number of boxes is 1550. 
The VRPTW test problems used are the R1 and R2 (with 25 clients) of Solomon and for the CLP test problems, the BR2 of Bischoff and Ratcliff.
